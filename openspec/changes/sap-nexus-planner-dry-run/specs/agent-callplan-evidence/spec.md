## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Closed-set capability selection
The system SHALL select capabilities only from the Registry closed set and MUST reject unsupported intent before Gateway execution. The selector SHALL emit an explicit five-state `MatchDecision` (`SELECT` / `CLARIFY` / `REJECT` / `SHOW_OPTIONS` / `ESCALATE_TO_PLANNER`) replacing the implicit `SelectionResult`. The selector SHALL route recognized single intents to their registered capability IDs across executor types (for example `inventory_availability` -> `MM.Inventory.GetAvailability` via `JCO_RFC`, `purchase_order_list` -> `MM.PurchaseOrder.GetList` via `ODATA`) without the Agent needing to know the executor type or binding at selection time. LLM-assisted selection MUST be constrained to the same closed set and MUST NOT introduce new executable capability IDs.

The rule parser and LLM parser SHALL detect multiple intents in a single utterance. When more than one capability intent is detected, the selector MUST emit `ESCALATE_TO_PLANNER` with a record and explanation, and MUST NOT silently reduce to the first-matched single capability.

#### Scenario: Route single inventory intent to SELECT
- **WHEN** the parser identifies a single `inventory_availability` intent with required `material` and `plant`
- **THEN** the Agent emits `MatchDecision.decision_type=SELECT` for `capabilityId=MM.Inventory.GetAvailability` and proceeds to CallPlan and Gateway validation
- **AND** the Agent does not choose an executor type or binding at selection time

#### Scenario: Route single purchase order intent to SELECT
- **WHEN** the parser identifies a single `purchase_order_list` intent with at least one filter parameter
- **THEN** the Agent emits `MatchDecision.decision_type=SELECT` for `capabilityId=MM.PurchaseOrder.GetList` and proceeds to CallPlan and Gateway validation

#### Scenario: Multi-goal utterance escalates to planner
- **WHEN** the parser detects both inventory availability and purchase order list intents in one utterance
- **THEN** the Agent emits `MatchDecision.decision_type=ESCALATE_TO_PLANNER` with a record and explanation
- **AND** the Agent does NOT silently select the first-matched capability or call Gateway validate or execute

#### Scenario: LLM selects registered capability only
- **WHEN** the LLM returns a single `capabilityId=MM.Inventory.GetAvailability` or `MM.PurchaseOrder.GetList` with required parameters
- **THEN** the Agent accepts the candidate only after deterministic validation confirms the closed-set capability and emits `SELECT`

#### Scenario: LLM returns unknown capability
- **WHEN** the LLM returns an unknown or unsupported `capabilityId`
- **THEN** the Agent emits `MatchDecision.decision_type=REJECT` and does not call Gateway validate or execute

#### Scenario: False SELECT fails regression
- **WHEN** a multi-goal utterance is silently reduced to a single `SELECT`
- **THEN** the matcher Eval marks this as a regression failure
